Backstage Pass

Events like TEDxBoulder, the Great American Beer Festival Leftapalooza, and the Aspen Food & Wine Festival rely on volunteers to set up and run the event. 

I have volunteered for a few of these events, and I found the volunteer application process to be varied across events and in some cases not so smooth. I found out that one of the events I volunteered for had about 50 volunteers, all managed by one guy, who sent out individual emails to individual volunteers thanking for their help and giving out the details about the event..... imagine doing that for 50 different people! 

I want this app to solve problems for two different audiences:

   * event managers: Automate this volunteer selection/coordination process, to make it easier to to find and ‘hire’ volunteers. Also retain past volunteers’ information in order to contact them for other events.

   * volunteers: Be first to hear about fun events that are looking for volunteers. Earn karma whenever you volunteer at the event (by checking in on the app or on your phone)
