Backstage Pass

Events like TEDxBoulder, the Great American Beer Festival Leftapalooza, and the Aspen Food & Wine Festival rely on volunteers to set up and run the event. 

I have volunteered for a few of these events, and I found the volunteer application process to be varied across events and in some cases not so smooth. I found out that one of the events I volunteered for had about 50 volunteers, all managed by one guy, who sent out individual emails to individual volunteers thanking for their help and giving out the details about the event..... imagine doing that for 50 different people! 

I want this app to solve problems for two different audiences:

   * event managers: Automate this volunteer selection/coordination process, to make it easier to to find and ‘hire’ volunteers. Also retain past volunteers’ information in order to contact them for other events.

   * volunteers: Be first to hear about fun events that are looking for volunteers. Earn karma whenever you volunteer at the event (by checking in on the app or on your phone)

      * When the volunteer gets to the event, they can check in on their phone to earn points

   *** PROBLEM: Become a Volunteer is not pushing the entire event Object ID into the person's user data.
 

Technologies

   * Bootstrap
   * Node, Express, with MVC
   * Object orientation - Your application must keep the model (data) separate from the view (display). Data should be encapsulated in classes (defined by constructors) and rendering should happen in a separate step. Follow the example set by Inspirational Quotes or Restaurant UI. If you use a client-side MVC library it may provide its own method of object instantiation.
   * MongoDB/Mongoose - to store data
      * Mongoose schemas for volunteers, event managers, and events
   * Heroku - an actual server
   * AJAX - to make small, quick, partial requests to the database, and display quickly to the client, without refreshing the entire page

Presentation

   * Sign up Event Manager
