Eventbrite is an app to sell tickets, and check in guests at the door.
THIS will be an app to manage event volunteers.

The problem: Events like TEDxBoulder, festivals like the Great American Beer Fest Leftapalooza, and Nedfest, rely on volunteers to set up and power the event. To volunteer for an event like this, there wasn’t an automated process, it was just apply on an online form, then receive an email if you were accepted, then another email about a pre-event meeting, then you showed up at the event and wrote down that you attended, then you got your free tshirt and free admission. On the part of the volunteer, this is a pretty smooth process, but on the part of the event host, they needed to repeat this process for however many volunteers they ended up 'hiring'.

This app solves problems for 2 parties:

   * event managers: Automate this volunteer selection/coordination process, to make it easier to to find and ‘hire’ volunteers. Retain past volunteers’ information in order to contact them for the next year’s event.

   * volunteers: Be first to hear about cool events that are looking for volunteers! Earn karma whenever you volunteer at the event (by checking in on their app or on your phone)

Technologies

   * Bootstrap
   * Node, Express, with MVC
   * Object orientation - Your application must keep the model (data) separate from the view (display). Data should be encapsulated in classes (defined by constructors) and rendering should happen in a separate step. Follow the example set by Inspirational Quotes or Restaurant UI. If you use a client-side MVC library it may provide its own method of object instantiation.
   * MongoDB/Mongoose - to store data
      * Mongoose schemas for volunteers, event managers, and events
   * Heroku - an actual server
   * AJAX - to make small, quick, partial requests to the database, and display quickly to the client, without refreshing the entire page
